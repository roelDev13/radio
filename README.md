# Radio Player

## Overview
This project's premise was intended to learn the process of application of an API into React. A radio music player was chosen as a topic of interest in order to see what music radio stations where available, and be able to tune in. This project was made using React, HTML, SCSS, implementation of the Radio-Browser-API, and React JS Audio Player.

## Setting Up
Before starting up the application, we are going to need to install our dependencies with:
```md
# Install required dependencies
npm install
```

After doing the last step, we can begin typing the next line into our terminal to start running our app:
```md
npm start
```

## Getting started  
You will be greated by the "all" tab, which displays all available music radios, then you can begin by selecting other tabs which will filter by the respective genre selected.
